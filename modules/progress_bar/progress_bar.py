class PBar(IModule):
    """
    Here's why this class is run in a separate process
    we need all modules to have access to the pbar.
    so for example, profile is the one always initializing the pbar,
    when this class isn't run as a proc, profiler would be the only proc
    that "knows" about the pbar
    because it initialized it right?
    now when any txt is sent to be printed by the output proc by anyone
    other than the profiler
    the output proc would print it on top of the pbar! and we'd get duplicate
    bars!

    the solution to this is to make the pbar a separate proc
    whenever it's supported, the output.py will forward all txt to be printed
    to this class, and this class would handle the printing nicely
    so that nothing will overlap with the pbar
    once the pbar is done, this proc sets the has_pbar shared var to Flase
    and output.py would know about it and print txt normally
